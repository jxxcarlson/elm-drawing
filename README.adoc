This repository is a series of experiments in making
drawings using Elm.  Therefore it will likely change a lot.

Run the code the examples folder to see
how the modules `Geometry`, `Shapes`, and `Iterate` are used. You can use
the Elm reactor: clone the repository, cd into it, and run `elm-reactor`

Look at the `images` folder to see the output produced by the
code in the `examples` folder.

- `composition1.elm`: "abstract art" with circles, ellipses, and rectangles. Uses
   `src/Geometry`
- `composition2.elm`: A sequence of circles of decreasing size, each one tangent
   to the preceding one. Uses `src/Shape`
- `composition2b.elm`: The same as above, but using iteration of maps to produce
   the image. The drawing calls on the code in `src/Iterate` and `src/Shape`.

Geometry:: provides utilities for translating and scaling SVG objects as
well as chaining these transformations together.

Shape:: provides (1) an AbstractCircles class that is easy to manipulate, (2)
a function to map AbstractCircles to SVG circles

Iterate:: provides a utility for constructing the orbit of a map:
`[a, f(a), f(f(a)), .. ]`.  In combination with various transforms, one
can use `Iterate` to easily make drawings with repeated elements,
as in `src/Composition2b.elm`
