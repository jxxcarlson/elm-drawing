![Composition 1](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/elm-drawing/blob/master/images/composition2.png?raw=true)

This repository is a series of experiments in making
drawings using Elm.  Therefore it will likely change a lot.

Run the code the examples folder to see
how the modules `Geometry`, `Shapes`, and `Iterate` are used. You can use
the Elm reactor: clone the repository, cd into it, and run `elm-reactor`

Look at the `images` folder to see the output produced by the
code in the `examples` folder.

- `composition1.elm`: "abstract art" with circles, ellipses, and rectangles
- `composition2.elm`: A sequence of circles of decreasing size, each one tangent
   to the preceding one.
- `composition2b.elm`: The same as above, but using iteration of maps to produce
   the image
